# Miscellaneus userstyles

A collection of miscellaneus stylesheets to be used with
[Stylish](https://userstyles.org). Most of the stylesheets are prototypes or
otherwise incomplete styles I have written mainly for my personal use.

Other (possibly more complete) userstyles I have written can be found under my [userstyles.org account](https://userstyles.org/users/285860) or in my other
[GitHub repositories](https://github.com/ristomatti?language=css&tab=repositories).
